# Bedun Family Bedun Family is an Android application providing a digital solution to the displacement of refugees across the globe.
The app can be used by a refugee to trace a family member miissing along the refugee route, or by a certified aid worker, acting on their behalf.

A refugee's details are recorded and are then searchable by other users. Enough details are recorded to be identified by a family member, without discolsing personal, sensitgive information. A search algorithm sources the most probable matches. Upon accepting a possible match, each user exchanges a short voice message. If both users confirm that the voice message belongs to their missing family member, then an aid organisation in the local area is brought in to establish re-unifacion.

The concept arose from personal experieince of working within a refugee camp. A mobile phone is the most valuable posession of a refugee, as a means of staying in contact with home and family and also sending and recieving currency. WHilst corssing borders along the route, smart phones can be lost, stolen or contacts lost through changing to a sim in a different locale. The app provides a solution by empowering refugees to re-connect with their family members. The app is available in 14 Languages##
